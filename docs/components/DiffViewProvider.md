# DiffViewProvider

The `DiffViewProvider` component is responsible for facilitating virtual file editing and managing the diff view experience within Visual Studio Code. It provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Opening Files for Editing**
   - Handles opening existing files or creating new files for editing.
   - Creates necessary directories for new files.
   - Manages the state of the file being edited (e.g., original content, edit type).

2. **Real-time Content Streaming**
   - Streams content updates to the diff editor in real-time.
   - Applies decorations to highlight the active line and fade out lines that haven't been updated yet.
   - Scrolls the editor to the current line as content is streamed.

3. **Change Previewing**
   - Provides a side-by-side diff view, showing the original file content and the edited content.
   - Allows users to preview changes before saving.

4. **Change Merging**
   - Handles merging user edits with the original content.
   - Detects and reports auto-formatting changes applied by the editor.
   - Identifies and reports new problems (e.g., linter errors) introduced by the changes.

5. **Change Saving and Reverting**
   - Saves the edited content to the file system.
   - Reverts changes if the user denies the operation or if an error occurs.
   - Cleans up temporary files and directories created during the editing process.

The `DiffViewProvider` interacts with other components like `DecorationController` to manage visual decorations in the editor. It also integrates with the file system and diagnostics services to read/write files and detect new problems after editing.

## Key Methods

### `open(relPath: string)`
Initializes the diff view for a file, setting up the original content, creating necessary directories (for new files), and opening the diff editor.

### `update(accumulatedContent: string, isFinal: boolean)`
Streams content updates to the diff editor, applying decorations and scrolling to the current line.

### `saveChanges()`
Saves the edited content to the file system, merging user edits, detecting auto-formatting changes, and identifying new problems.

### `revertChanges()`
Reverts the changes made to the file, restoring the original content or deleting the file (for new files).

### `reset()`
Resets the `DiffViewProvider` to its initial state, closing the diff editor and cleaning up resources.

## Workflows

1. **Opening a File for Editing**
   - The `open` method is called with the relative file path.
   - The original file content is retrieved (or an empty string for new files).
   - Necessary directories are created for new files.
   - The diff editor is opened, showing the original content on the left and an editable view on the right.

2. **Streaming Content Updates**
   - As the assistant generates content, the `update` method is called with the accumulated content and a flag indicating if it's the final update.
   - The content is streamed to the diff editor, applying decorations and scrolling to the current line.
   - If it's the final update, any remaining lines are handled, and decorations are cleared.

3. **Saving Changes**
   - The `saveChanges` method is called after the final content update.
   - User edits and auto-formatting changes are detected by comparing the content before and after saving.
   - New problems (e.g., linter errors) are identified by comparing diagnostics before and after the edit.
   - The final content, including user edits and auto-formatting changes, is saved to the file system.
   - The diff editor is closed, and the file is opened in the regular editor.

4. **Reverting Changes**
   - The `revertChanges` method is called if the user denies the operation or an error occurs.
   - For new files, the file and any created directories are deleted.
   - For existing files, the original content is restored, and the file is opened in the regular editor.

5. **Resetting the Provider**
   - The `reset` method is called to clean up resources and reset the provider's state.
   - The diff editor is closed, and internal state variables are reset.
