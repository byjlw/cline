# LmStudioHandler

The `LmStudioHandler` component is responsible for handling communication with the LM Studio API, providing an interface for sending requests and receiving responses. It implements the `ApiHandler` interface and provides the following key functionalities:

1. **API Request Handling**
   - Sends requests to the LM Studio API for text generation or other tasks.
   - Supports streaming responses from the API.

2. **Model Information**
   - Provides information about the configured LM Studio model, including its ID and default settings.

The `LmStudioHandler` class interacts with the OpenAI library to communicate with the LM Studio API, as LM Studio uses a compatible API interface.

## Key Methods

### `createMessage(systemPrompt: string, messages: Anthropic.Messages.MessageParam[])`
Sends a request to the LM Studio API for text generation, using the provided system prompt and conversation history.

### `getModel()`
Returns an object containing the configured LM Studio model ID and its default settings (e.g., max tokens, support for computer use).

## Workflows

1. **API Request Handling**
   - The `createMessage` method is called with the system prompt and conversation history.
   - The `LmStudioHandler` converts the input messages to the OpenAI format.
   - A request is sent to the LM Studio API using the `chat.completions.create` method.
   - The API response is streamed back, and the `LmStudioHandler` yields the generated text as it becomes available.
   - If an error occurs during the request, a generic error message is thrown, suggesting checking the LM Studio developer logs for debugging.

2. **Model Information Retrieval**
   - The `getModel` method is called to retrieve information about the configured LM Studio model.
   - The `LmStudioHandler` returns an object containing the model ID and the default OpenAI model settings.
