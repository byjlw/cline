# MistralHandler

The `MistralHandler` component is responsible for handling communication with the Mistral AI API, providing an interface for sending requests and receiving responses. It implements the `ApiHandler` interface and provides the following key functionalities:

1. **API Request Handling**
   - Sends requests to the Mistral AI API for text generation or other tasks.
   - Supports streaming responses from the API.

2. **Model Information**
   - Provides information about the configured Mistral model, including its ID and default settings.

The `MistralHandler` class interacts with the Mistral SDK to communicate with the Mistral AI API.

## Key Methods

### `createMessage(systemPrompt: string, messages: Anthropic.Messages.MessageParam[])`
Sends a request to the Mistral AI API for text generation, using the provided system prompt and conversation history.

### `getModel()`
Returns an object containing the configured Mistral model ID and its default settings (e.g., max tokens, support for computer use).

## Workflows

1. **API Request Handling**
   - The `createMessage` method is called with the system prompt and conversation history.
   - The `MistralHandler` converts the input messages to the Mistral format.
   - A request is sent to the Mistral AI API using the `chat.stream` method.
   - The API response is streamed back, and the `MistralHandler` yields the generated text and usage information as it becomes available.

2. **Model Information Retrieval**
   - The `getModel` method is called to retrieve information about the configured Mistral model.
   - The `MistralHandler` checks if the configured model ID is valid and returns an object containing the model ID and its default settings.
