# OllamaHandler

The `OllamaHandler` component is responsible for handling communication with the Ollama API, providing an interface for sending requests and receiving responses. It implements the `ApiHandler` interface and provides the following key functionalities:

1. **API Request Handling**
   - Sends requests to the Ollama API for text generation or other tasks.
   - Supports streaming responses from the API.

2. **Model Information**
   - Provides information about the configured Ollama model, including its ID and default settings.

The `OllamaHandler` class interacts with the OpenAI library to communicate with the Ollama API, as Ollama uses a compatible API interface.

## Key Methods

### `createMessage(systemPrompt: string, messages: Anthropic.Messages.MessageParam[])`
Sends a request to the Ollama API for text generation, using the provided system prompt and conversation history.

### `getModel()`
Returns an object containing the configured Ollama model ID and its default settings (e.g., max tokens, support for computer use).

## Workflows

1. **API Request Handling**
   - The `createMessage` method is called with the system prompt and conversation history.
   - The `OllamaHandler` converts the input messages to the OpenAI format.
   - A request is sent to the Ollama API using the `chat.completions.create` method.
   - The API response is streamed back, and the `OllamaHandler` yields the generated text as it becomes available.

2. **Model Information Retrieval**
   - The `getModel` method is called to retrieve information about the configured Ollama model.
   - The `OllamaHandler` returns an object containing the model ID and the default OpenAI model settings.
